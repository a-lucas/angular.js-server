All the client code is written in ES6 and supports decorators. 


To run the two test servers, 

```!bash
mkdir server/logs
gulp serve
```

This executes `node server/angularonserver.js server` and `node server/angularonserver.js client` in the background and redirects it's output into the log files `/server/logs/` .

To play with the ES6/7 client in the /src folder, run

```!bash
gulp watch-client
```
