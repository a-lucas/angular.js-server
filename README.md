# Requirements

1- Your angular app must use html5mode. The reason behingd this requirement is that browsers don;t send the hasbang fragment to the server.

So for example, renderng on the server side http://domain.com/url#blah will just render http://domain.com/url.

2- You must use a modified version of AngularJS ( while I get the time to write the tests to contribute to Angulat source code. )


# Examples

They are located in test. To run them, you must edit your /etc/hosts file


All the client code is written in ES6 and supports decorators.
